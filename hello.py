# ==================== Python Print and Environment Info ====================

#  To print something in Python, we use the print() function
print("Hello, world!")

# To check the Python environment (useful to know which version is running)
#    we can use the built-in sys module which gives system-specific parameters
import sys

# This will print the current Python version being used
print("Python version:")
print(sys.version)
